% MKAE IT TALK ABOUT THE APORACH AND NOT CASE STUDY
\begin{abstract}
The misalignment between the social and technical dimensions of software development has been
linked to losses in developer productivity~\cite{cataldo:esem:2008} and increases the likelihood of a build to fail~\cite{kwan:tse:2011}.
Although the research investigating the effects of the misalignment showed ample evidence of its negative effect on productivity and software quality it has yet to produce actionable knowledge that managers and developers can act upon.
We propose an approach that generates recommendations to alleviate the mismatches between the social and technical dimensions of a software project to lower the number of failing builds.
The evaluation of our approach using data from the IBM Rational Team Concert\texttrademark\ project showed that we can recommend pairs of developers that form the mismatch between the social and technical dimensions.
These pairs were statistically related to build failure and offer to managers and developer opportunities to improve the chance that the current build will succeed.
Two developers that form a mismatch can improve the alignment between the social and technical dimensions by initiating coordination.

%In a case study of
%coordination in the IBM Jazz\texttrademark\ project, we investigate the
%communication and technical dependencies between developers involved in
%software builds and relate their misalignment to the build failure.  
%Through our proposed approach we identified a number of developer pairs that did not communicate  their dependencies and thus increased the likelihood of build failure. 
%Upon this actionable knowledge, developers and managers can act to prevent build failure. 
%If any one of these pairs is present in a build's social network, the build had at least a 74\% chance to fail. 
%This has several practical implications for the design of collaborative systems, such as the integration of recommendations about inter-personal relationships.

\section{Introduction}
We hypothesize that with the ever growing size of software teams the lack of
effective coordination is the main source of integration failures. The
development work that precedes integrations involves significant coordination of
developers that work in teams and need to rely on the code of others. 
Unfortunately, code is often anything but stable, further contributing to developers' need to coordinate with one another and stay up to date with code changes that impact their work.
%But often code is everything but stable, further contributing to
%developers' needing to coordinate to keep up with code changes that impact their work. 
This problem is
amplified in software builds that integrate an entire team's work
and on which the delivery of new features depends. Not only do
failed builds destabilize the product~\cite{cusumano1997}, but they also demotivate
software developers~\cite{holck2004}.

%Keeping integrations builds error-free can be a very time consuming
%process. 
One major challenge with integrating work across teams is coordination~\cite{cataldo:esem:2008}.
Coordination problems can arise from many factors including organizational,
social or technical reasons~\cite{herbsleb:icse:1999}. Being able to pinpoint
mismatches between technical dependencies and required communication that
relate to build failure is even more important for a team's
ability to devise strategies to avoid this problem.
%Thus an approach to support developers to identify co-workers they need to coordinate with in order to avoid the up coming build from breaking is called for.
Thus it is important to initiate an approach that supports developers in identifying coworkers that they need to coordinate with in order to avoid an up coming build from breaking.

Previous
research~\cite{wolf:icse:2009,hassan:ase:2006} trained predictive models to assess the quality of software builds without the need to invoke large test
suits. Although this research
reaches a high degree of accuracy in their predictions, knowing that a
build will fail does not necessarily help developers to prevent it from failing.
The goal of this research is to find a way to create actionable knowledge to avoid
integration failure.

In this paper we describe an approach that is evaluated using data from the IBM's Jazz project where we leverage
information about socio-technical developer coordination and software builds to
identify pairs of developers that increase the likelihood of a build failing. From historical project information we extract information about developers with technical dependencies
as well as their ongoing cooridnation.
From this, certain pairs of developers that have a negative influence on the build outcome are identified. Developers and management can
act upon this knowledge to avoid future build failure.

Through the application of our proposed approach we uncover the existence of pairs of
developers that if technically dependent in a build but not discussing their
dependencies, have a negative influence on build success. This
actionable knowledge can be integrated in real-time recommender systems that
indicate, based on project historical data, which developer pairs tend to be
failure related. Developers and management can then devise strategies to
prevent the failure before build time. 


We hypothesize that due to the high coordination needs the absence of this
important coordination increases the likelihood of build failure. 
Thus, we
investigate pairs of developers that share a technical dependency without talking
with each other (referred to as \emph{technical pairs}):

\textbf{RQ} How can we identify developer pairs that negatively influence build success?
 

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relwork}
We aim to integrate work that investigates team collaboration to produce actionable knowledge upon which developers can act.
Several studies are relevance with respect to different dimensions of our work:

\paragraph{Factors that affect software builds}
To the best of our knowledge the studies by Hassan et al.~\cite{hassan:ase:2006}
and Wolf et al.~\cite{wolf:icse:2009} are the only studies that conducted
research to predict build outcome. Hassan et al.~\cite{hassan:ase:2006} found
that a combination of social metrics (e.g. number of authors) and technical
metrics (e.g. number of code changes) derived from the source code repository
yield to be best predictor. 
On the other hand Wolf et al.~\cite{wolf:icse:2009} showed that communication structure has an influence on the build outcome.
Kwan et al~\cite{kwan:tse:2011} investigated socio-technical networks with an emphasis on technical dependencies among developers that is not accompanied with any coordination activity on build outcome (gap).
Although Kwan et al work showed a relationship between the amount of gaps and build failure, we take the next step in showing how to capitalize on these gaps to create actionable knowledge.

\paragraph{Coordination in software development}
In order to manage changes and maintain quality, developers must coordinate. In
software development, coordination is largely achieved by communication through those sharing work dependencies~\cite{kraut1995:coordination}. 
The software engineering literature is recognizing the role of communication as essential~\cite{nakakoji2010:rdc}.
Several researchers in the software engineering community investigated the effects of communication on several topics such as knowledge distribution~\cite{ehrlich:icgse:2006}, coordination~\cite{hinds:cscw:2006}, and Conway's Law~\cite{cataldo:cscw:2006}.
We build onto those findings in devising an approach that improves team communication.


\paragraph{Coordination and failure in software development}
Coordination among developers is often represented in the form of social networks.
These social networks, when related to actual code artifacts, can be used to predict the artifact's failure-likelihood.
Several studies showed that metrics derived from social networks form good failure predictors (e.g.~\cite{meneely:fse:2008}).
Furthermore, when combining these social networks with information of organizational hierarchies~\cite{nagappan:icse:2008}, or geographical distance~\cite{bird:acm:2009}, yield not only better predictors but also shine a light on other factors influencing the difficulty of coordination.
% herbsleb grinter
Herbselb and Grinter~\cite{herbsleb:icse:1999} found that coordination impacts integration efforts.
We take the findings that show the influence of coordination on software quality and combine them with technical dependencies among developers to generate actionable knowledge.

The mismatch between implied coordination needs, characterized by work dependencies, and actual coordination, referred to as socio-technical gap, are related to low productivity~\cite{valetto:msr:2007} and low software quality~\cite{kwan:tse:2011}.
Kwan et al~\cite{kwan:tse:2011} investigated the occurrence of socio-technical gaps throughout builds in the Rational Team Concert project highlighting that builds that contain more gaps are more likely to fail.
Valetto et al~\cite{valetto:msr:2007} uncovered a similar insight into productivity related to implementing work items showing that the existence of gaps is a major cause for low productivity.
These finding suggests that the mismatch between implied coordination needs and actual coordination should be avoided to both guarantee high productivity and software quality.
  

%MOVE THOSE DOWN
%A gap is represented by two developers that share a technical dependency (implying coordination need) without any social interaction (implying
%unmet coordination need).
%In this paper, we refer to these pairs of developers as \emph{technical pairs} (there is a gap), and to those that do
%share a socio-technical dependency (there is no gap) as \emph{socio-technical pairs}.

\section{Formulating the Approach}
Motivated by research showing that the existence of socio-technical gaps can cause a build to fail leads us to formulate an approach that generates actionable knowledge to alleviate socio-technical gaps.
Our approach takes into account the past history of a project analyzing socio-technical gaps with respect to their individual relation to build failure.
These recommendations aim at initiating coordination between two developers that form a gap in the current build, thus increasing the chance of a build to succeed.
Thus supporting projects that use electronic repositories such as automated build engines, version control and task management.

For our approach we define gap as two developers that share a technical dependency (implying coordination need) without any social interaction (implying unmet coordination need).
For example, two developer that changed the same file can be consider to share a technical dependency.
In this paper, two developers that share a technical dependency are referred as a \emph{technical pair} (or socio-technical gap).
In contrast if two developers that share a technical dependency but coordinated they work are referred to as  \emph{socio-technical pairs}.
For example, two developers that discuss their work through email are said to coordinate and if they additionally share a technical dependency form a socio-technical pair.
%
We further define a technical and a socio-technical pair to be \emph{corresponding} if both pairs consist of the same pair of developers.

To answer our research question, we propose the following approach to analyze the technical pairs in relation to build failure:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We identify all technical pairs across all builds in the project which form the current set of technical pairs.

\item From our current set we remove all technical pairs that are not statistically related to build failure forming a set of statistically harmful pairs. To determine the statistical relationship we employ a Fisher exact value test comparing the frequency of occurrence in failed vs successful builds by counting for each technical pair in how many failed and successful builds it occurs.

\item From the set of statistically harmful pairs we remove all technical pairs that have a \emph{corresponding} socio-technical pair that is statistically related to build failure (using a Fisher exact value test as mentioned above) forming the set of recommendations.

\item We split the set of recommendations into two sets of recommendations.
The first set contains those which have a corresponding socio-technical pair that is statistically related to build success (using a Fisher exact value test as mentioned earlier) whereas the second set contains the remaining technical pairs.

\item We rank the developer pairs in each of the two sets of recommendations using the coefficient $p_x$,
which represents the normalized likelihood of a build
to fail in the presence of the specific pair:
$$
p_x\text{=}\frac{ \text{pair}_{failed} / \text{total}_{failed} }
                     { \text{pair}_{failed} / \text{total}_{failed} + \text{pair}_{success} / \text{total}_{successs}}
$$
The coefficient is comprised of four counts: (1) pair$_{failed}$, the number of failed builds where the pair occurred; (2) total$_{failed}$, the number of failed builds; (3) pair$_{success}$, the number of successful builds where the pair occurred; (4) total$_{success}$, the number of successful builds.
A value of $p_x$ closer to one means that the developer pair is strongly related to build
failure. 
Note that we need to adjust the p-values of the Fisher Exact Value test to account for multiple hypothesis testing using the Bonferroni adjustment.
\end{enumerate}

The approach produces two sets of recommendations both containing technical pairs that are related to build failure.
The first set consists of technical pairs that have an equivalent socio-technical pair that is related to build success.
The second set consists of technical pairs that do not have an equivalent socio-technical pair that is related to either build outcome.
Both sets of technical pairs represent recommendations of pairs of developers that should communicate in order to increase the chance of a build to succeed. 
The technical pairs contained in the first set have a potentially larger influence on increase build success due to converting a build failure related pair into a build success related pair.



\section{Preliminary Evaluation}
To evaluate our approach we used data provided by the IBM Rational Team Concert\texttrademark\ development team.
Rational Team Concert is a product that integrates source code management, agile planning, and issue management into a single server/client application that the team itself uses for development.
The Rational Team Concert product allows developers to link changes they made directly to work items, thus establishing within their repository traceable links between builds and work items through the changes they made.
The repository spans three months in which the team started 326 builds, 99 of which failed and 227 that were successful.
The team consists of more than 100 developers distributed across seven major sites in Europe, Asia, and North America.


In Rational Team Concert we conceptualize a \emph{technical pair} as two developers that modified the same file in a build.
Two developers comprise a \emph{socio-technical pair} in Rational Team Concert if they modified the same file in a build and commented on a work item that was linked to the build they changed the same file for.

\input{significant-pairs}

\emph{Preliminary Results.}
Through applying our proposed approach we found a total of 2872 developer pairs in all the constructed socio-technical networks, out of which 961 were technical pairs (step 1).
Of these 961 technical pairs we found 120 to be statistically related to build failure (step 2). 
We chose to present the top twenty technical pairs that are statistically related to failed builds in Table~\ref{tab:pairs}.

We then removed of the 120 \emph{technical pairs} all the corresponding \emph{socio-technical pairs} that are related to failure (step 3).
Only 23 of the 120 technical pairs had an existing corresponding socio-technical pair of which none were statistically related to build success or failure.
Thus, step 4 yields only one non-empty list of technical pairs.

In step 5 we ranked the failure related \emph{technical pairs} (see Tables~\ref{tab:pairs})
by the coefficient $p_{x}$. This coefficient indicates the strength of
relationship between the developer pair and build failure. For instance, the
developer pair (Adam, Bart), appears in 13 failed builds and in 3
successful builds. This means that pair$_{failed}$ = 13 and pair$_{success}$ = 3
with total$_{failed}$= 99 and total$_{success}$= 227 result in $p_x$= 0.9016.

%\vspace{-20pt}
\end{figure}

To further validate our findings, we applied the approach to all builds before a given build A and used the technical pairs inducing build failure to build a logistical regression model predicting the outcome of build A.
Applying this method to all builds yields Figure~\ref{fig:prediction} which shows the recall (black) and precision (green) values for the a logistical regression model used for prediction.
The recall and precision are cumulative at each point, including the prediction results obtained for the previous builds.
The logistical regression ended with a precision and recall value of $.43$ (median: $.45$) and $.67$ (median: $.67$) respectively, thus outperforming a random guess based on the ratio between failed and successful builds.
This further suggests that the technical pairs that our approach identifies have an influence on build outcome, which in turn supports the importance of investigating those technical pairs further.

%WHAT DO THOSE NUMBERS FOR THE PREDICTION MEAN

Most technical pairs that are related to build failure consist of developers belonging to
different teams. Naggappan et al.~\cite{nagappan:icse:2008} found that using the
organizational distance between people predicts failures. They reasoned that this
is due to the lack of awareness of what people separated by organizational distance
work on. Although the Jazz team strongly emphasizes communication
regardless of team boundaries, it still seems that organizational distance has
an influence on its communication behaviour.

\emph{Threats To Validity.}
\label{sec:threats}
We performed all our analysis on one set of data, the Rational Team Concert\texttrademark\
repository, limiting the generalizability of our findings.
First, since the three months  we studied were directly before a major release of the project, 
we believe that this dataset represents instances in which the lack of coordination (gaps) has the biggest impact on builds.

Secondly, we assumed that every developer commenting on, or subscribed to, a work item reads all comments of that work item. 
However, by manual inspection of a selected number of work items, we found that developers who commented on a work item were aware of the other comments, confirming our assumption.

%Thirdly, Socio-technical dependencies may suffer from the combination of social and technical dependencies. 
%Social dependencies might not be related to the code changes the technical dependency was inferred from.
%Since the changes we used are directly linked to work item discussion we are confident that the vast majority of matches are appropriate.


\section{Conclusion and Next Steps}
Motivated by findings in the literature suggesting that socio-technical gaps increase build failure~\cite{kwan:tse:2011},
we hypothesized that these findings can be made actionable.
In this paper we proposed an approach that is capable of generating actionable knowledge that helps developers to prevent builds from failing.

Our results from the Rational Team Concert project indicate that 
the influence of developer pairs with a socio-technical gap on the build
failure was very high.
This knowledge can be used to improve the chances of the upcoming build to succeed.
Managers that oversee the work of several developers can initiate coordination between developers that form a technical pair identified by our approach.
Similarly, a developer that is part a technical pair can coordinate her work with her colleague to remove the risk posed by this open gap.

% We also found that historical project information about technical pairs and software
%builds can be used in a model that predicts the quality of upcoming builds.
%This means that if any one of the twenty most frequent failure related pairs was present in a social network of a build, the build had at least an 74\% chance to fail.

%PUT MORE

As a next step to compliment the preliminary results presented in this paper, we have planned three follow up studies:
% MORE HERE be more explicit
(1) We want to examine the extent to which the technical pairs identified by our approach cause builds to fail. 
In our current approach we presented statistical evidence that the technical pairs relate to build failure, as a next step we will examine each technical pair and the failed builds it occurred in to determine if the technical pair actually cause the build to fail.
For example, we plan identifying the changes that broke a build and relate it back to the developers that made the changes and those that were affected by these changes.
%
%HOW CAN IT BE USED

(2) Create a tool that provides recommendations based on the technical pairs to the developer, that can be evaluated with other developers in the field.
By comparing teams that do use the recommender system with those teams that do not, we plan on determining the effect the recommendations generated by our approach have on lowering the number of breaking builds.

(3) Refine the definition of coordination and its needs, by both leveraging alternative conceptualizations of technical and social dependencies.
For example, we currently define two developers to share a technical depends if they modified the same file, we plan on using alternative conceptualizations such who uses code that has been modified.
