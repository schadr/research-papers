# research-papers #

This repository contains all the latex files and images I used to write my papers. 
For those papers where appropriate I try to also add the small scripts I used for 
data analysis or point to the respective github repository of the programs I wrote.

The folders in this repository represent the papers which are ordered by year, main conference/journal, sub-event and keyword in case more than one paper was submitted to the same venue.
