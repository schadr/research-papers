Integrated collaborative software engineering tools such as IBM
Jazz\texttrademark provide researchers opportunities to access a 
vast amount of information that reflects the real development activities 
of software teams. With all of the artifacts stored in one place and 
linked together, researchers can gain valuable insights about the 
teams' collaborative activities. We report on our experience in mining the Jazz 
development team repository to study collaboration in sofware develpment. In
particular we explain the different options and constraints we had
during our efforts to mine the Jazz repository. In addition, we show
some results we obtained by studying communication practices in the Jazz
project team to demonstrate our research with data obtained from the mining
process.
%We think our experience is applicable to any research data mining project not just only on Jazz but for any other collaborative software engineering tools.
